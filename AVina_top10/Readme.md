# Vina Output Analysis
---
We have screened 5000 molecules from the *Zinc Database* against one pocket from the `6zsl` NSP13 structure. Binding energies were calculated by *AutodockVina* and saved as `vina_log.txt`. The table was read and visualised using *R*. Consequently, the top 10 molecules were extracted with the smallest binding affinities.  
Here are the `Zinc Database Identifiers`:
1. ZINC000514436632
2. ZINC000104309836
3. ZINC000620748806
4. ZINC000019015192
5. ZINC000104277568
6. ZINC001164872284
7. ZINC001164979321
8. ZINC000101042701
9. ZINC000101042701
10. ZINC000095523345

These molecules were further investigated.
